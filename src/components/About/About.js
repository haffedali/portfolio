            <p className="aboutText">I started programing in Python one year ago and haven’t looked back. I’ve recently completed Berekely’s Web Dev bootcamp, and can quickly and confidently learn or self teach relevant technologies. I am an analytic person and tenaciously solve any problems presented to me. I am an aspiring back end engineer, and love dedicating myself to a project. Communication is one of my strong points, and I am a firm believer in the adage ‘two heads are better than one’</p>
