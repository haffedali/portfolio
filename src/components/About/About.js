                <p className="aboutText">   My name is Haffed Ali and I have a passion for programming. I have finished Berkeley's Wed Dev bootcamp in Fall 2018. During the three month course, I learned various languages and frameworks relevant to the bay area tech scene.I value teamwork as I believe that "two heads is better than one". <br /><br />
                    During the bootcamp, it allowed me to explore a few projects that required working with several different team members (located in the 'Projects' tab). Those opportunities allowed me to understand my interpersonal skills such as communication, time management, and helped sharpen my problem solving abilities.<br/><br /> 
                    I am striving to work in the back end as I find it my strongest suit. I am a fast learner but I also like to immerse myself into my projects. I am looking for a place where I can grow professionally and continue my growth as a developer. Please feel free to explore my portfolio. If you would like to further discuss about anything, please find how to contact me in the tab provided. Thank you.
